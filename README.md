# Running in Docker
*Docker-compose.yml* file contains all dependencies for the application. 

## Adding Data
Add downloaded csv files of journeys in `./server/data/journeys` and stations in `./server/data/stations`. **Don't forget to __remove add_journeys_csv_here__ and add_stations_csv_here files from the folders** 

## Running The Project

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
This will start up all the instances required. First let the mongo-import to import all the data into mongodb. Once all the data is inserted this instance will exit. You can then use the application

Backend will run on *localhost:3000*
Frontend will run on *localhost:5000*  

by default. Changes can be made in *docker-compose.yml* file. 

### Note: You can disable mongo-import configuration from docker-compose.yml file if you wish **NOT** to import data again once it is already imported. Make sure you also change depends on from mongo-import to mongo in backend and frontend configurations.

## Tests

Tests can be run in frontend folder *./react-client*

`npm test`  

# Running Locally

This application can be run locally by setting up environment and adding dependencies. 

- Setup mongodb server [Setting up MongoDb server Locally](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/)
- Data is being imported through *MongoImport*. [Install mongoimport](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/database-tools/mongoimport/) and set environment path

- Backend: 

  - Add the downloaded csv data into *./server/data/journeys* and *./server/data/stations*.**Don't forget to __remove add_journeys_csv_here__ and add_stations_csv_here files from the folders** 


  -`cd ./server/`
  
  - create .env like provided example.env in *./server* or you can simply rename the example.env to *.env* 

  -Run `npm install` **Note: Node 16 or latest is required.**

  -Run `node ./scripts/import.js` and wait for import.js script to finish importing all the data

  -Run `npm run start` to start the server

- Frontend 

  -`cd ./react-client` 

  -Run `npm install` 

  -Run `npm run dev` to start the frontend. 

- Testing

  - `cd ./react-client`

  - Run `npm test` to run cypress E2E tests in terminal or you can also open Cypress UI by running `npx cypress open`
